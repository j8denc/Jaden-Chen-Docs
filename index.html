  Exploration 01: New York City & My Hometown
</h2>
<section>
    <ol>
      <li>Brief 
        <ul>In this article, I explore the evolving concept of global cities and the responsibilities associated with them, focusing on New York City. As Chinese international student, I chose to compare the unique sense of home found in New York's Chinatown, emphasizing the cultural connections and comfort it provides. I also investigates the NYC's historical and contemporary socio-economic and ethnic divisions.</ul>

  <li>Brief 
    <ul>In my article about the Column of Constantine, I discuss the historical significance of this Roman monument. I also explore the Column's history and raises questions about Constantine's religious shift to Christianity and his choice to depict himself as Apollo, exploring potential compromises between Christian and Roman beliefs.

  <ol>
    <li>Brief
      <ul>
       In my exploration of urbanity through maps, I began with a study of the French Concession in Shanghai, uncovering the European influence on an Eastern colony. Warsaw's map unraveled the transformation of the city, from Napoleonic-era perspectives to land usage in pre-WWI Poland. And a remarkable post-World War II map of Warsaw unveiled the city's resilience and evolution. 
      </ul>

<section>
  <ol>
    <li>Brief
      <ul>In this project, I examine the differences and similarities between the old towns of Warsaw and Istanbul. The most striking difference is the geographical layout: while Warsaw's old town is centrally located within the new town, Istanbul's old and new towns are separated by the sea, leading to a unique urban divide.  
      </ul>

  <ol>
    <li>Brief
      <ul>I discuss a DIY skatepark known as Szaber Bowl, which was built illegally under an old bridge in the center of Warsaw. The skaters used stolen or obtained materials and completed the project in a year. Even it was built on a busy main bridge but connects with Warsaw's underground youth culture and stands as a symbol of rebellion and community for skaters.

    <li>Brief
      <ul>Bernardo Bellotto's painting portrays the city of Warsaw in its pre-World War II glory, which played a vital role in preserving the city's reconstruction after WWII. However, it also prompts contemplation on whether such restoration efforts are an attempt to hide or rectify a history of failure, or if they symbolize a genuine, action-based expression of patriotism.

        <li> Migration: Due to the conflict in Ukraine, the solidarity between Poles and Ukrainians is influenced by shared cultural heritage and historical ties. </li>
        <li> Cultural Identity: The techno music community in Warsaw, with a history dating back nearly 30 years, serves as a space for rebellion, resistance, and cultural expression.</li>

<section>
<ol>
    <li>Brief
      <ul>In this article, I discuss the perception of European culture in China, specifically Vienna's role as a symbol of European-ness. The "Golden Hall" became a cultural icon, representing the allure of European classical music and heritage. In contrast, Tirana, Albania, is presented as an exception to the European identity due to its primarily Muslim population and the absence of classical European architecture.

    <li>Brief
      <ul>The article highlights the historical transition from diverse forests to uniform rows of fast-growing trees for human use, emphasizing the pursuit of efficiency and legibility.  However, the article points out that legibility can also empower the state to control citizens through standardized systems, which may disproportionately affect ethnic minority groups.

<ol>
    <li>Brief
      <ul>This article discusses the emergence of "Gopnik" culture at the turn of the 21st century and its evolution from Russian street gangs in 1992. This subculture is deeply rooted in Russian identity and has influenced social class, masculinity, and had an international impact in a rapidly changing world. I also explores how Gosha Rubchinskiy integrated Gopnik aesthetics into popular culture, transforming Gopniks from a marginalized group in Russian society into a globally recognized aesthetic.
